# Data Structures

Contains notes and practice for different data structures seen in coding problems. Each structure will have its own directory with NOTES.md and programming files and examples.

Purpose is to provide an abstraction layer on top of data and allow easier implementations with algorithms. Also allows code to be easier to read.

Mostly based on [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsB6SWUrDFW2RmDotAfPbeHu)

All source code for examples is held in `src/`
